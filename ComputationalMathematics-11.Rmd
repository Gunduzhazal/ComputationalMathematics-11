## Data 605 - Assignment 11

**Hazal Gunduz**

**Using the “cars” dataset in R, build a linear model for stopping distance as a function of speed and replicate the analysis of your textbook chapter 3 (visualization, quality evaluation of the model, and residual analysis.)**

**Loading Data**

```{r}
head(cars, 10)
```


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

**Visualization**

```{r}
plot(cars$dist, cars$speed, main = "Speed vs Distance", col = c("green", "blue"))
```

**Quality Evaluation of the Model**

```{r}
cars_linearmodel <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
summary(cars_linearmodel)
```

```{r}
plot(cars, xlab = "Stopping Distance", ylab = "Speed", col = c("green", "blue"))
abline(cars_linearmodel)
```


**Residual Analysis**

```{r}
plot(fitted(cars_linearmodel), resid(cars_linearmodel), col = c("green", "blue"))
```

```{r}
qqnorm(cars_linearmodel$residuals, col = "green")
qqline(cars_linearmodel$residuals, col = "blue")
```
